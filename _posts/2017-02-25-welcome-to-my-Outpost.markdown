Welcome to my new website, I was messing around with stuff and this ended up being published.  It's really just something for me to have fun with.  I am currently learning a bunch of different programming languages all at once, fundamentals and such.  Even if I know how to do something I've just been letting it guide me through.  This was one of the lessons, so wham! We have a website.  I used Jekyll to pre-create the website, I'll leave some stuff down here for those that are interested.  Anyhow, Thanks for showing up and reading this crap.
